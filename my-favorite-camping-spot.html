  <h1>GOLDEN TULIP RESORT</h1>
  <img src= "images/pexels-photo-338504.jpeg" alt= "photo of a resort">
  <P>My favorite camping spot is golden tulip. it is a private,family friendly, alchohol-free spot. It is located on a gorgeous 70-acre ranch, one hour north of Calabar, between Obudu and Ikot. The campsites are set in mature trees in a natural no-concrete setting next to a hill top and cattle ranch. If you are looking for a peaceful retreat that the whole family will enjoy, this is the place for you.</P>
